# 🛠️ Ergodox Custom Build – DIY Open-Source Mechanical Keyboard from Scratch

This project documents the complete, **from-scratch** creation of a fully custom **ErgoDox** mechanical keyboard, built using open-source tools and homemade fabrication techniques.

## ✨ What Makes This Project Special?

- 🔧 **Built entirely from scratch**: No pre-made kits were used—everything was sourced, designed, or assembled by hand.
- 🖨️ **3D-printed molds and components**: All [molds](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4283186) for the case were printed using a 3D printer. The case mold bases were printed in PLA with an FDM printer.
- 🎨 **Custom-designed, resin-printed keycaps**: Keycaps were printed using a **resin printer** with **mechanical-grade resin** for durability. The engraved symbols are painted **white from the inside** to make them stand out through the semi-transparent surface.
- 🐧 **Custom SUPER key**: Includes a special keycap featuring the **Linux penguin** for the SUPER key.
- 🧱 **Resin case with alcohol ink dyes**: The case was cast in resin using silicone molds and **tinted with alcohol-based dyes**, producing a cloud-like mix of black and blue tones.
- ⌨️ **Custom QMK firmware**: Powered by [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/), fully programmable via the [ZSA Configurator](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/6pvpn/latest/0).
- 🔌 **Coiled interconnect cable**: The cable between the two halves of the keyboard is coiled manually to keep the setup **clean and tidy**.
- ⛺ **Tent kit support**: This build includes a [tenting kit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4241793) for ergonomic tilt and wrist comfort *(not visible in the photos yet, as it's pending black paint)*.

## 🧩 Project Components

- **PCB**: Based on the open-source [Ergodox design](https://www.ergodox.io/).
- **Microcontrollers**: Teensy USB Board, Version 2.0.
- **Custom keycaps**:
  - Printed in resin using **durable, mechanical-grade resin**.
  - Symbols painted internally for enhanced visibility.
  - Includes a **custom Linux SUPER keycap**.
- **Resin case**:
  - Mold bases printed in **PLA** using a filament (FDM) printer.
  - Silicone poured to create flexible negative molds.
  - Cast in resin with **alcohol inks** for aesthetic effects.
- **Mechanical switches**: Cherry MX Brown.
- **Tent kit**: For ergonomic positioning (not yet shown in photos).

## 🧠 Keyboard Layout

This build uses a custom layout for the Ergodox EZ to be used on my [hyprland config](https://github.com/akerraps/hyprconfig). You can view and customize it via the ZSA online configurator:

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to **Iñigo Alonso Bilbao** for his invaluable help in designing the silicone molds and working with resin casting and resin printing my keycaps. This project wouldn’t have been possible without his guidance and collaboration during the case fabrication process.
